Q1. Find the missing number in the series:  
2,3,10,15,26,35,50,63,?  
 
Implement the solution within Angular in which, a text box is given along with a button.  User can enter any index of the 
series and at the button click; the page should display the number at that entered index.  


<input (input)="tcode=$event.target.value" type="text" class="form-control">
<button class="btn btn-success"  (click)="submit()">Submit</button>
<h4 id="display"></h4>
